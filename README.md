## Usage
This tool requires `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `PIL`.



In command line:



Type `$ python convert_image.py` and you will see `Image path?> ` followed by the path to the image and press Enter to execute.



When executed, the files `converted.code.lua`, `converted.png`, and `converted.colors.png` will be generated.



The `converted.code.lua` file can be pasted directly into the TIC-80's code editor for execution.
